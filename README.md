# Tea Shopper

 Tea Shopper is a command line interface that scrapes tea data from the web and allows users to compare teas by name, price per ounce, and tea shop. When the user chooses a tea, it displays specific details, such as purchase URL, flavors, region, and description.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
```ruby
    gem 'tea_shopper'
```

And then execute:
```
    $ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```
    $ gem install tea_shopper
```
## Usage

Type the code below and follow the prompts to find your next great tea.
```
    $ bin/tea_shopper
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
